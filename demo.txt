In a study by Redmon et al. (2018), YOLOv3 was shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in object detection tasks, outperforming many traditional object recognition methods by offering faster processing times while maintaining accuracy. The modelâ€™s backbone architecture, Darknet-53, further enhances its ability to extract features from images, making it particularly effective in challenging real-time environments like warehouses and retail settings
